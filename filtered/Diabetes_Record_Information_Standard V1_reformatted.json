It is the highest level to logically group data elements that may be independent or related. For example, ‘Medications and\n                                            medical devices’ includes sets of related elements with dependencies between the elements whereas 'Social context' includes a set of independent elements or information items, grouped in a logical section.</li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Record entry</span> │ A record entry within a section is used where a set of information is repeated for a\n                                            particular item, and there can be multiple items.

This clarifies how many entries can be made i.e. zero, one or many entries. The number of records expected and allowed are displayed as: 0……* = zero to many record entries are allowed; 0……1 = zero to one record entry is allowed; 1……1 = one record is expected; 1……* = one to many records are expected. For example,\n                                                the ‘Medications and medical devices’ section may have zero to many medication item records in it and is displayed as 0…… *.    </li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Conformance</span> │ Conformance defines what information is ‘mandatory’, ‘required’ or ‘optional’ and applies to sections, record entries, clusters and elements. The IT system must\n                                                be developed to be handle all the information elements that are defined in the Standard but not all the information is required for every individual record or information transfer. The following set of rules apply to enable implementers to cater for the end users (senders and receivers) requirements: Mandatory – the information must be\n                                                included; Required – if it exists, the information must be included; Optional – a local decision is made as to whether the information is included. These rules apply at all levels and give the flexibility to allow local clinical or professional decisions on some information that is included, while being clear on what is important information to\n                                                include. For example, a person subject to a referral may have many assessments, but not all of these will be relevant to the referral.<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"> NB</span>: It is permitted to upgrade a conformance rule but not to down grade one. For instance, a section that is classed as optional in the standard can be upgraded to required or\n                                                mandatory in local implementations. However, one that is classed mandatory or required cannot be downgraded to required or optional. </li><li><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Valuesets</span> │ Valuesets describe precisely how the information is recorded in the system and communicated between systems. This is required for interoperability (for\n                                                information to flow between one IT system and another).  The information can be text, multi-media or in a coded format. If coded it can be constrained to SNOMED CT and specific SNOMED CT reference sets, NHS Data Dictionary values or other code sets.</li></ul>\n                                        <div><span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">2.2 How we expect the Diabetes Record Information Standard to be used</span>\n                                            <br clear=\"none\"/>\n                                            <br clear=\"none\"/>\n                                            <p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 12.35pt .5pt;\">What is defined is a set of information which should be common to most systems recording information to support a person's direct diabetes care.

It may be that in such cases initial 'simpler' implementations may preferentially send and receive pre-calculated metrics and preformed graphical representations of the data for display to the end-user (e.g. Ambulatory Glucose Profiles (AGPs) shared as PDFs) with a view to progressing to more complex/\n                                                sophisticated implementations later.

For example, a person with diabetes self-managing their condition at home may record their own blood pressure or conduct self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). They may also be using diabetes devices\n                                                including CGM, connected insulin pens or ambulatory insulin pumps. In all cases it is important that the full context of the information is known (where and when the measurement was done and by whom or what device). The principle, for PRSB standards, is that for clinical safety and efficacy of communications, the key contextual data described within\n                                                the PRSB Provenance Data Standard should be easily accessible to the end-user of any implementation of the Diabetes Record Information Standard. The principle applied in the information model is that where it is important (from a professional perspective) to know who or what device undertook the activity and who or what device recorded the that this\n                                                is made available to the end-user accessing the record.

These should be visible to the end user together and in the user-interface. For example, the PRSB consultation identified the Ipswich Touch Test * as an assessment that is being increasingly used by professionals and people with diabetes as part of their routine foot examination (see assessments). However, other clinically similar rapid footcare assessments, such as the 10g monofilament test would be recorded under the examination findings section of the standard as these are coded as clinical finding concepts in SNOMED CT. Ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) and Toe brachial pressure index are observable entity concepts in SNOMED and would be recorded under observations.</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">SNOMED CT ID</span>   │   <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Fully specified name (FSN)</span>  │  <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Implementation guidance</span></p><p>299910003 │ Finding of light touch (finding) │ Descendants of concept for 10g monofilament outcome recorded in Examination findings</p><p>252059006 │ Vascular measure (observable entity) │ Descendants of concept for e.g., toe brachial index, ankle brachial pressure index and lower limb doppler pressures recorded in Observations.</p><p>1443851000000100 │ Ipswich Touch Test score (observable entity) │ Equal of concept recorded in Assessments or Observations.</p><p>763258007 │ Site, Ischemia, Neuropathy, Bacterial Infection and Depth classification total score (observable entity) │ Equal of concept recorded in Assessments or Observations.</p><p>763004009 │ University of Texas Wound Classification System grade (observable entity) │ Equal of concept recorded in Assessments or Observations.</p><p>763005005 │ University of Texas Wound Classification System stage (observable entity) │ Equal of concept recorded in Assessments or Observations.</p><p>1099121000000104 │ Young Townson FootSkin Hydration Scale for Diabetic Neuropathy level (observable entity) │ Equal of concept recorded in Assessments or Observations.</p><p><br/> * [See https://doi.org/10.1111/dme.12450 ; https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.jcte.2021.100252]</p><p><br/> Where required codes are unavailable the free text field should be used and consideration given to the submission of a new code request to UK SNOMED CT request submission portal (see https://isd.digital.nhs.uk/rsp/user/guest/home.jsf).

For the purposes of this standard this concept is preferred to 434910001 |Interstitial fluid glucose concentration (observable entity)| although both concepts are active and neither are currently conformant with SNOMED CT Encoded Unified Test List (UTL) Editorial Principles (see https://hscic.kahootz.com/gf2.ti/f/972002/57976005.9/PDF/-/UTL_SNOMED_Editorial_Principles_v1.6.pdf) and may be superseded in future releases.</p>\n<p>* Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) guidance on blood glucose meters states that “[i]t is essential that accurate records are kept for all aspects of blood glucose testing. This could include…calibration…patient results [etc]…Blood glucose meter test strips generally use capillary whole blood as a sample…Some blood glucose meter test strips are calibrated to give results that are comparable with laboratory glucose results, and these are termed ‘plasma calibrated’. Plasma calibrated test strips give results that are approximately 12% higher than whole blood results [(see https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/403511/Point_of_care_testing_-_blood_glucose_meters.pdf)].” SNOMED CT concepts used to record results from devices should unambiguously represent what was reported as measured by the device.  Therefore device reported glucose readings from interstitial fluid and blood/ plasma (including plasma calibrated) samples should not be coded interchangeably (see also https://dx.doi.org/10.1177%2F1932296817699637). Where these results are used for calculation of summary glucose metrics reporting molar concentrations these are given as ‘substance concentration in capillary blood’ (see summary observations section).</p>\n</div><div>\n<p>The following is a non-exhaustive list of other codes that may be relevant to a person's diabetes self-management and should be used when sharing/ recording the corresponding observations:</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">SNOMED CT ID</span> │ <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Fully specified name (FSN)</span> │ <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Implementation guidance</span><br/> <br/> 271649006 │ Systolic blood pressure (observable entity) │ Vital sign.

Other examples: 200 mcg/min or 200 mcg/1 minute; 1 liter/8 hours.\n                                        Sometimes, a rate can imply duration when expressed as total volume / duration (e.g. 500mL/2 hours implies a duration of 2 hours). However, when rate doesn't imply duration (e.g. 250mL/hour), then the timing.repeat.duration is needed to convey the infuse over time period.",
